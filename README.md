I chose the following [Digital Ocean challenge](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/pages/kubernetes-challenge):

> Deploy a log monitoring system
So your applications produce logs. Lots of logs. How are you supposed to analyze them? A common solution is to aggregate and analyze them using the ELK stack, alongside fluentd or fluentbit.

# Step 1

Create Kubernetes Cluster via [Digital Ocean's Control Panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/create-clusters/).

# Step 2

Download/Connect to Kubernetes

`brew install kubectl`
