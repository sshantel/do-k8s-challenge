# Step 1

Create Kubernetes Cluster via [Digital Ocean's Control Panel](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/create-clusters/).

In K8s, a `context` is used to group access parameters under a name. The configuration for every cluster will contain a stanza for contexts with cluster-specific values which look like this:

# Step 3

Install doctl, the official CLI for Digital Ocean API.

`brew install doctl`, then `doctl auth init`, which prompts you to authenticate doctl for use with your DigitalOcean account.

# Step 4
